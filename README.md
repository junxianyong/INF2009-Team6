# **INF2009-Team6**: Dual-Gate Access Authentication with 2-Factor Authentication (Voice + Camera)

## Project Description

This project is a dual-gate access authentication system that uses 2-factor authentication. The system is composed of
two gates. The first camera on first gate is the face recognition gate, which uses the camera to capture the face of the
person trying to enter. The second camera on first gate will prevent tailgating. The second gate is the face and voice
recognition gate, which uses the camera to capture the face of the person trying to enter and the microphone to capture
the voice of the person trying to enter. The system will only allow access if the person is recognized by both gates.
The system will also have a web interface that will allow the user to add new users, delete users, and view the logs of
the system.

Based on the profiling results:

* **Model Loading:** VGG (Keras) has the largest model size and load time, while MobileFaceNet (TFLite) is the smallest
  and fastest to load.
* **Pipeline Performance:** MobileFaceNet (TFLite) with MediaPipe offers the fastest total pipeline time. VGG (Keras) is
  significantly slower, especially in the embedding generation step.
* **Framework Impact:** MediaPipe generally results in faster face detection compared to OpenCV.
* **Model Format Matters:** TFLite models are generally faster than their TensorFlow Frozen Graph (PB) or Keras
  counterparts.
* **Function Calls:** VGG (Keras) has a significantly higher number of function calls, indicating greater complexity or
  overhead.

## 4. 🚶‍♂️‍➡️ Motion Detection

The `motion_detection.py` script implements motion detection using OpenCV.

### 4.1 Workflow:

1. **Frame Capture**: Captures video frames from a specified camera.
2. **Preprocessing**: Converts each frame to grayscale and applies a Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
3. **Motion Detection**: Compares the current frame with the previous frame to identify differences. Thresholding is
   applied to highlight significant changes.
4. **Contour Detection**: Identifies contours in the thresholded image, representing areas of motion.
5. **Motion Indication**: If the area of any contour exceeds a predefined minimum area, motion is considered detected,
   and a message is printed.

### 4.2 Key Parameters:

- `camera_id`: ID of the camera to use.
- `resolution`: Resolution of the captured video.
- `threshold`: Threshold value for motion detection.
- `min_area`: Minimum area of a contour to be considered motion.
- `blur_size`: Size of the Gaussian blur kernel.
- `check_interval`: Time interval between motion checks.

## 5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Human detection

Within the airlock itself, we should only allow 1 person in at a single moment. Hence, we have to detect if multiple
people are within it.

There are multiple ways of doing so: we can use opencv natively and code out a human detection. This is simple and
extremely lightweight, but highly inefficient due to how insufficiently trained it is.

![photo_2025-03-25_02-24-36](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ce28ef-7a29-418d-9d54-2f971941e4ff)

*OpenCV incorrectly detecting humans*

Another method of approaching this is to use Tensorflow Lite human detection system built on top of YOLOv5 tflite model.
Utilizing both Tensorflow lite and YOLOv5 models, this human detection system is much more effective in accruately
detecting people, especially when there is multiple people (i.e. detecting a city square). Although, a stronger hardware
would be required.

## 6. 🔊 Voice Authentication

As voice authentication was a vital part of the authentication process, including both the voice password and the voice
signature analysis, the system was broken down into two parts accordingly.

### 6.1 1️⃣ Starting Premise

The edge devices would be connected through LAN cables to the internet, providing secured access through the premise's
internet and firewall.

The voice authentication process occurs **after** confirming the identity of the personnel, meaning there is no need to
determine their identity beforehand.

Voice enrollment is performed on the fog device, while authentication is carried out on the edge. Thus, updates to
personnel’s unique voice passwords are transferred from the fog device to the edge device.

Ensuring the **security** of voice authentication during these updates is **critical**.

### 6.2 ⚙️ Approach to Premise

A **simple solution** was chosen to match voice signatures and passwords **without** relying on deep learning models (
which can be heavyweight and have costlier inference).

The approach involves matching voice signatures by calculating the **linear normalized distance** of the MFCC features
between the enrolled and authentication voice samples. This allows developers to **customize a threshold value** based
on testing to separate voice signatures.

A **speech recognition library** was used to capture the voice passwords. Both speed ⚡ and accuracy 🎯 were crucial,
leading to testing (below) to identify the most suitable library.

After recognition, **voice passwords are hashed and serialized** for secure transmission to the edge device.

### 6.3 🧪 Testing

🛠️ Five speech recognition models were tested:

- Sphinx
- Google Speech Recognition
- Wit.ai
- Houdify
- Whisper

**Google Speech Recognition** provided the **best accuracy** and **speed** for word inference.

Since authentication involves waiting, minimizing **wait times** was a priority.

### 6.4 🚨 Problems Encountered

🛠️ Due to differences in **hardware** on edge and fog devices, the team suspected a **significant amount of noise** was
picked up by the edge device.

**Fog devices (often laptops) apply noise reduction automatically**, leading to cleaner recordings. Additionally, the
differences in hardware (I.E. the microphone) might affect the output.

Edge devices, however, recorded **noisier audio**, causing **failed authentication attempts**.

### 6.5 🛠️ Solutions Employed

The team **split development** into two alternate paths:

1️⃣ **Lightweight approach** (MFCC features comparison)

- **Noise reduction** using the `noisereduce` library when recording on the edge device.
- A **first authentication pass** using the noise-reduced WAV file to extract MFCC features.
- If this **fails**, a **second authentication pass** applies **noise-reduction on MFCC features** instead.

2️⃣ **Noise-reduction profile development**

- **Recorded samples** from fog and edge devices were analyzed.
- **Signal-to-noise ratio** was calculated for each feature.
- Features were adjusted by a **scale factor** to improve authentication accuracy.

📊 **Example testing results**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9214537e-35ec-4c56-b9db-9228a104f752)

📌 **Observations**:

- ✅ **Same individual authentication**: After denoising, embedding distance **reduced by 57 points** (125.39 → 67.61).
- ❌ **Different individual authentication**: Embedding distance **only reduced by 10 points** (104.06 → 93.69).

This **simpler algorithm** selectively **reduces embeddings using noise estimates**, enabling **more reliable
authentication** across **Fog and Edge devices** without deep learning.

### 6.6 🧠 Alternative Deep Learning Approach

**Deep-learning-based method**:

- Utilized `resemble-ai/Resemblyzer` ([GitHub](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer))
- Generates a **256-value summary vector** per audio file.

**Comparison**:

| Approach                        | Features Used | Speed    | Storage | Noise Handling |
|---------------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Lightweight (MFCC)**          | 20 values     | ✅ Fast   | ✅ Low   | ⚠️ Moderate    |
| **Deep Learning (Resemblyzer)** | 256 values    | ❌ Slower | ❌ High  | ✅ Strong       |

🔍 The **deep-learning approach** accounts **better** for:

- **Different recording hardware**
- **Environmental noise**

However, it has **higher inference time** and **storage costs**.

---

### 6.7 ✅ **Final Decision:**

For **lightweight** and **efficient** authentication across devices, **the MFCC-based approach was prioritized**. Deep
learning remains an **alternative** for future enhancements.

🚀 **Next Steps:**

- Optimize **threshold calibration** for different noise profiles.
- Improve **real-time denoising** on edge devices.
- Evaluate **hybrid approaches** for further robustness.

---

### 6.8 🎉 **Conclusion:**

Through **adaptive noise reduction** and **threshold tuning**, a **lightweight, scalable** voice authentication system
was implemented—ensuring **fast, reliable** authentication without **heavy AI dependency**.

## 7. 📌 State Diagram

The state table and state diagram are shown below. The state diagram is a visual representation of the state table. The
state table shows the states of the system, the conditions that trigger the transitions between states, and the actions
to take when transitioning between states. The state diagram shows the states of the system as nodes and the transitions
between states as edges. The state diagram is a useful tool for understanding the behavior of the system and for
designing the system.
